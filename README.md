# Covid-19 Analysis

This project pulls from the [Covid-19 API](https://covid19api.com/) and analyses information from all counties across California and cross-chekcs with the US Census API for the year of 2021. This project analyses whether lower median income results in higher death rates across counties and whether minority populations are impacted more severely by Covid than non-minority populations.
